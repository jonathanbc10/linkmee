## Description

linkmee is a linktr.ee alike site that allows you to centralize your links and present them with beautiful SVG icons. With linkmee, you can create a personalized page with your social media profiles, website, and any other important links you want to share. The site provides a clean and visually appealing interface, making it easy for visitors to navigate and access your various links.

The project is built using React and utilizes SVG icons for each link. It leverages Vite as the development server and build tool.
